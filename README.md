# SimpleCooking

I often read about new cool stuff in the angular universe and think yeah I want to try it. But to try new things you need a project and I was fed up with TODO-Apps. So I create this project to try all things like new architecture, new features, new libraries etc.

## Wats included now:

* Angular
* Ngrx
* NestJs
* Google Login
* JWT Tokens
* Mongoose

## Is this best pracites?

I thing building business applications is a huge topic nowadays. There is so much information about new frameworks and architectures and libraries, but what is the best library, what is the best pattern and the best architecture?

To figure this out I need to find out what works and what not. Because we're all biased in some things and we do not like other things. So best practise depends not only on system and requirements, mostly yes, but sometimes we want to build it our way because it feels better. To me best practise is what me helps to keep my code clean, reuseable and robust and what is fun ;-).

## What can I do with it?

You can do whatever you want. Use this repo as reference, let it inspire you or just ignore it, it is up to you.

## So why simple cooking?

Yes, indeed it is a project with a purpose :-). This application should help you to plan your meals and organize your recipes. It searches for recipes based on your available ingredients or your mood (vegan or meat). And maybe some more stuff if I can think of something.

## Future goals

Libs to test

* formly
* form-state either ngrx-forms or forms-manager

Code

* Dashboard
* Search for recipies
* create new entries (private and public)
* favorite recipies
* create meal plan for whole week

Other

* Push via sockets
* SSR - Angular universial
* Angular PWA
